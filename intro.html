        Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born German politician who led Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. He is infamous for his role in the Holocaust, the systematic genocide of approximately six million Jews, and for instigating World War II. 

Hitler's rise to power was fueled by his charismatic leadership, anti-Semitic rhetoric, and the economic turmoil of the Great Depression. His regime was characterized by authoritarianism, militarism, and the suppression of civil liberties. 

Hitler's policies led to the invasion of Poland in 1939, triggering World War II. The war resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and the devastation of Europe. Hitler committed suicide in 1945 as Nazi Germany was defeated.
